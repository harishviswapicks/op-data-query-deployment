Would you like me to proceed with implementing this enhanced platform? I can start with any specific component or feature that's most important to you. The modular design means we can build incrementally while maintaining your existing functionality.

What aspect would you like to tackle first - the enhanced layout, data source management, or the scheduling system?

okay looks good. please implement. match the styles of the chatbot exactly. do not build any api calls. do not build the backend only focus on the frontend.

Perfect! I'll implement the enhanced AI data platform frontend that matches your existing chatbot styles exactly. Since you want me to focus purely on the frontend without API calls, I'll create a comprehensive interface with mock data and interactive components.

## 🎯 __Implementation Plan__

I'll build this in phases, creating new components that seamlessly integrate with your existing chatbot while maintaining the exact same visual style and design patterns.

### __Phase 1: Enhanced Layout Structure__

- Create a new main dashboard component with sidebar navigation
- Implement data source selection panel
- Add conversation history with search functionality
- Build agent selector with enhanced profiles

### __Phase 2: Core Features__

- Scheduling interface for automated reports
- Query templates library
- Enhanced chat interface with multi-source context
- Visualization placeholder components

### __Phase 3: Advanced Features__

- Collaborative tools (sharing, comments)
- Analytics dashboard
- Export functionality
- Advanced search and filtering

## 🎨 __Style Matching Strategy__

I'll ensure perfect style consistency by:

- Using the exact same color scheme and design tokens
- Matching typography, spacing, and component styling
- Reusing your existing shadcn/ui components
- Following the same card-based layout patterns
- Maintaining the same responsive behavior
